# my_graphics_design
Graphics in Python mean visual output created using code — such as drawings, animations, or interactive visuals.
Instead of only printing text in the console, Python can show shapes, images, colors, motion, and designs.

🧠 Purpose of Using Graphics

Developers use graphics in Python for:

Learning basic logic visually (loops, conditions, coordinates)

Creating games (e.g., using turtle or pygame)

Data visualization (charts with matplotlib or seaborn)

GUI development (interfaces with Tkinter or PyQt)

Art and design (pattern generation, fractals, spirals)
